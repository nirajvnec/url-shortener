Hey team, to make it easier to identify the type of work from Jira titles at a glance, can we follow a consistent prefix format for ticket summaries? Here's a suggested structure:

UI: → For frontend-only tasks

API: → For backend/API-only tasks

DB: or BP: → For database-related work

UI + API: → For tasks involving both frontend and backend integration
