I was checking the API built by the OneRisk team at the Security Service end, and based on our understanding, we expected the API to return user roles as shown in the attached screenshot (e.g., PB-MR-MEMBER, PBI-MTRM-CREDIT, etc.).

However, these roles do not appear to exist in Active Directory, and weâ€™re currently unable to retrieve them for any user through the API.

Could you please help with either of the following:

Clarify how and where these roles are mapped or stored?

Provide a test user (or update an existing one) with one or more of these roles assigned so we can validate the API behavior and test the workspace dropdown filtering?


Let me know how you'd prefer to proceed.
