Can you please confirm whether both upload and download operations should be performed using the blob container mr-marvel-report-export, or if we are supposed to use the original container mr-marvel-report (or split usage between them)?

Additionally, we need clarification on file storage:
Will both .rdl (report definition) and .pdf (generated report) files be stored in the same blob container (mr-marvel-report-export) and possibly under the same folder structure, or will they be separated into different containers or subfolders?
